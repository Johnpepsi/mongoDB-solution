# mongoDB-solution
This repo contains how mongoDB works in 2024. As it currently have 7.0 at the time I am writing this file. I have installed both MongoDB.msi and Mongosh-2.1
I made this repo for my future reference when running a server and implementing a database that involves MongoDB on any project. 

# Here is how:
* Make sure to go on their website to download both of the zip file https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

* It has to be installed as msi so it can read the directory folder. Moving on from the installation, make sure to compare it from here and should stay all the same.

* Once successfully installed both of the folder, use the BASH Terminal to run the Mongosh spontaneously when running a database on the server.
## Here is the command: 
* alias mongod="/c/Program\ files/MongoDB/Server/7.0/bin/mongod.exe"
* alias mongo="/c/Program\ Files/MongoDB/Server/7.0/bin/mongo.exe"
* Make sure to change the version as I currently have 7.0 when writing this document. This version would probably change in the future.

## Result that should get after running MongoDB.
